# INTRO

This is my second ever project leveraging python. Now before I get into this project, I just want to put this out there that Amazon has always being a long time favorite working place I've dreamt of so doing this project wasn't somethoing I took lightly. lol

Well, in this project like always, I got the dataset from kaggle followed my stages of data analysis which are;

### Recommendations


# Data Cleaning

To start with, since this is python, I had to import my libraries and the libraries used in this project are Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib.pyplot and also import our csv file.

After which, we had to remove duplicates using drop_duplicates()

The next thing and off the bat was to drop all columns I shan't be using in this project so we use drop(columns = ), now we use inplace = True so that the change happens in the dataset there are other ways but this is so efficient

From here, we did alittle getting used to checks of this dataset so let's just shoe them

# Data Analysis

This is the part of the process where insights are gained from our dataset.Â  I will show it here

And we started answering some business questions on this.
